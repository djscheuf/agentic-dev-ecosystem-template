# EDD Refinement ProgressRecord

The `edd_refinement_workflow` persists durable, schema-versioned run state in the target repository under `.process/edd/<run_id>/progress.json`.

- `ProgressRecordStore` provides idempotent `create_or_resume`.
- `ProgressRecordSerializer` enforces the schema version, an explicit field allow-list, and redacts environment variables and credential-bearing paths before writing.
- `ProgressRecordFactory` derives a stable `run_id` from the Cadence workflow run id and the starting Git revision, and refuses duplicate creation.
- `InitializeRunActivity` verifies a successful `PreflightResult`, creates or resumes the progress record, and emits `InitializeRun` or `ResumeRun` events.
- `RunBaselineEvaluationActivity` invokes a pinned evaluation profile through a pluggable harness and records each attempt in the progress record.
- `BaselineResultParser` extracts and validates pass/fail/coverage metrics and failures from structured output.
- `BaselineResultArtifactWriter` writes the baseline result to a repository-relative artifact file.
- `PlanRefinementActivity` produces a `PlanningResult`, choosing `stop` when budgets or the regression limit is exhausted, validating proposed actions against the taxonomy and required-test-case mapping, and flagging `propose_evaluation_expectation_change` for human approval.
- `EddRefinementWorkflow` and `WorkflowModuleSpec` register the workflow and the three Cadence Activities with the orchestrator.
- `EddRefinementWorkflow.run` sequences `initialize_run`, `run_baseline_evaluation`, and `plan_refinement_action`, carrying the `TargetRepositoryContext` and run id through each step.

## Evaluation expectation approvals (2026-09-14)

- `ProgressRecord` schema version 2 persists the pending approval request and decision history.
- `EddRefinementWorkflow` gates evaluation expectation changes on the first valid matching Cadence signal and treats timeout as no approval.
- Approval decisions bind a stable proposal id to an exact diff hash; only matching approved hashes receive the `human_approved_evaluation_change` context.
- Client helpers send `approve_evaluation_change` and query `get_approval_status`.

## Approval completion details (2026-09-14)

- Replaying approval creation with the same pending proposal returns the original request and preserves its timeout start; conflicting or missing proposal context fails closed.
- Empty evaluation diffs bypass the approval gate, while late decisions after timeout cannot replace the recorded result.
- `python -m edd_refinement_workflow.approval_cli` provides `approve`, `reject`, and `status` commands with workflow, run, and proposal identifiers.
- The `plan_refinement_action` Cadence entrypoint accepts and returns proposal identifiers and diff hashes instead of raising its former placeholder error.

## Scoped candidate execution and validation (2026-09-15)

- `execute_refinement_action` runs the selected action through `DevinHarness` with an explicitly colocated `accept-edits` configuration and returns usage, ATIF path, changed files, and a canonical diff hash.
- Expectation-changing actions fail closed unless the approved hash matches the planned hash.
- `validate_candidate` rejects empty scope, no-op and out-of-scope diffs, malformed metrics, hash mismatches, and required-test weakening or ambiguous modifications.
- Candidate validation results use stable run-and-diff identifiers and append to `candidate_history` under a per-activity persistence lock.
- `EddRefinementWorkflow` resumes persisted candidates without rerunning the harness and exposes `get_candidate_status`.
